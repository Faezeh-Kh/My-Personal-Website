I am a research engineer in the Fermat laboratory of the R&D department of HUAWEI Technologies (Grenoble, France) where I work on model-based verification and validation techniques.

I received my Ph.D. in Software engineering from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (Nantes, France) in 2022 for my thesis titled ["A Testing Framework for Executable Domain-Specific Languages"](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03977604/).
I was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher ([ESR10](https://www.lowcomote.eu/esr/10/)) at the [Lowcomote European project](https://www.lowcomote.eu/), and for my research activity, I was a member of the [NaoMod](https://naomod.github.io/) group 
in the [Laboratory of digital sciences of Nantes (LS2N)](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en).
