I recently started a new position as a senior research engineer in the Modelling and Analysis research group of HUAWEI Technologies (Grenoble, France) where I work on Model-based verification and validation techniques.

I got my Ph.D. in Software engineering from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (Nantes, France) for my thesis titled "A Testing Framework for Domain-Specific Languages".
I was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher ([ESR10](https://www.lowcomote.eu/esr/10/)) at the [Lowcomote European project](https://www.lowcomote.eu/), and for my research activity, I was a member of the [NaoMod](https://naomod.github.io/) group 
in the [Laboratory of digital sciences of Nantes (LS2N)](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en).
