I am a PhD student of Computer Science at the [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (Nantes, France) and 
also a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher ([ESR10](https://www.lowcomote.eu/esr/10/)) at the [Lowcomote European project](https://www.lowcomote.eu/).
For my research activity, I am a member of the [NaoMod](https://naomod.github.io/) group 
in the [Laboratory of digital sciences of Nantes (LS2N)](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en).

Currently, I am working on advanced testing and debugging support for Executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSL)
under supervision of [Erwan Bousse](https://bousse-e.univ-nantes.io/), [Jean-Marie Mottu](http://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~mottu-jm/welcome-en.html), and [Gerson Sunye](https://sunye.github.io/).
