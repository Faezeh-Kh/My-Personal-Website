I recently defended my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (Nantes, France).
I was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher ([ESR10](https://www.lowcomote.eu/esr/10/)) at the [Lowcomote European project](https://www.lowcomote.eu/), and for my research activity, I was a member of the [NaoMod](https://naomod.github.io/) group 
in the [Laboratory of digital sciences of Nantes (LS2N)](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en).

As my PhD studies, I worked on a generic testing framework for Executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSLs)
under supervision of [Dr. Erwan Bousse](https://bousse-e.univ-nantes.io/), [Dr. Jean-Marie Mottu](http://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~mottu-jm/welcome-en.html), and [Prof. Gerson Sunye](https://sunye.github.io/).
