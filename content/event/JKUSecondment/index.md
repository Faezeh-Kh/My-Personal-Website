I was a visiting researcher in the Department of Business Informatics – Software Engineering ([WIN-SE](https://se.jku.at/)) at [JKU University](https://www.jku.at/en) (Linz, Austria),
working with [Prof. Manuel Wimmer](https://se.jku.at/manuel-wimmer/) and [Dr. Antonio Garmendia](https://se.jku.at/antonio-garmendia/) .
It was a secondment plan defined by the [Lowcomote](https://www.lowcomote.eu/) to establish collaborations between people involved in the project.
