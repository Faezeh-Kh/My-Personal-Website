In the 25th edition of the MODELS conference, I will take part in several roles.
First of all, I am honored to have an accepted paper in the foundation track and hopefully, I will present it at the conference.
I was also involved in the reviewing process as an external reviewer.
In addition, I am [a member of the program committee](https://conf.researchr.org/profile/models-2022/faezehkhorram) of the [Tools & Demonstration](https://conf.researchr.org/track/models-2022/models-2022-tools---demonstrations) track as well as a member of the organizing committee of the 4th edition of [Modeling Language Engineering (MLE) workshop](https://mleworkshop.github.io/editions/mle2022/).
