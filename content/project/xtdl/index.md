XTDL is a generic testing approach that provides testing facilities for executable DSLs.
This project is indeed the implementation of my paper titled "Adapting TDL to Provide Testing Support for Executable DSLs".
For theoretical information, please refer to the [paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03265196/).
