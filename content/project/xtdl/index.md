XTDL is a generic testing framework for Executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSL). It supports several features for testing executable models (the programs defined using the xDSLs), including test case definition, execution, quality evaluation, debugging, fault localization, and improvement. 
The framework is the output of my Ph.D. thesis and for theoretical information, please refer to my [publications](https://faezeh-kh.github.io/publication/).
