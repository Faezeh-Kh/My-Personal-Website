Modeling supports different levels of abstraction and hence, increases user involvement throughout the development.
SeGa4Biz particularly provides metamodels for creating Educational Serious Games (ESG) and
Game-Aware Process (GAP) models, and automates considerable parts of the modeling and development activities,
via model transformation. 
This project is indeed the implementation of my paper titled "SeGa4Biz: Model-Driven Framework for Developing Serious Games for
Business Processes".
